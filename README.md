This script is designed for analyzing and predicting global denudation rates using a Random Forest machine learning model within Google Earth Engine (GEE). The model leverages multiple environmental variables such as slope, precipitation, vegetation indices, and temperature to generate a high-resolution global map of denudation rates.
